- [Weather Dashboard Powered by OpenWeatherMap API](https://github.com/johnfritzel/weather-api-dashboard.git): An end-to-end weather data collection and visualization process that integrates Python for automated data retrieval via the OpenWeatherMap API and MySQL for seamless data storage. The system gathers weather data from over 300 major cities worldwide and delivers insights through interactive Power BI dashboard.
  
- [E-commerce Analysis with Data Pipeline](https://github.com/johnfritzel/ecommerce-pipeline-analysis.git): This project provides a comprehensive data processing pipeline for cleaning, analyzing, and importing e-commerce dataset from [Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data) into a MySQL database. The pipeline includes data profiling, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis capabilities.
  
- [Healthcare Staffing Data Analysis](https://github.com/johnfritzel/staffing-management): This project utilizes MySQL to process and analyze healthcare staffing data. The process involves cleaning, standardizing, and transforming nurse staffing records, with a focus on timecard entries, billing information, and shift details. The transformed data is then visualized and analyzed using Power BI.

- [Cryptocurrency Data Pipeline](https://github.com/johnfritzel/crypto-etl): This is an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline to gather cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap via **Web Scraping**. The clean data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database, readily available for analysis and visualization through an interactive dashboard.

- [Spreadsheet SQL Mapper](https://github.com/johnfritzel/spreadsheet-sql-mapper): This Django API lets you upload spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx only) and import their data into your database. It checks for:
  - Valid file formats (xls/xlsx)
  - Empty files
  - Blank cells within the spreadsheet
  <p>If the table you specify doesn't exist, the API creates it automatically. Then, it imports the data from the spreadsheet.</p>

- [CRM Application](https://github.com/johnfritzel/crm-application): A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application built using Django for the backend and Bootstrap and JavaScript for the frontend. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing customer data and interactions.
