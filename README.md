## Projects
- [Healthcare Staffing Data Analysis](https://github.com/johnfritzel/staffing-management): This project utilizes MySQL to process and analyze healthcare staffing data. The process involves cleaning, standardizing, and transforming nurse staffing records, with a focus on timecard entries, billing information, and shift details. The transformed data is then visualized and analyzed using Power BI.

- [E-commerce Data Pipeline and Analysis](https://github.com/johnfritzel/ecommerce-pipeline): This is an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline that processes and cleans e-commerce datasets from [Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data), a Brazilian e-commerce platform, and uploads the cleaned data to a PostgreSQL database.
  
- [Cryptocurrency Data Pipeline](https://github.com/johnfritzel/crypto-etl): This is an Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) pipeline to gather cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap via **Web Scraping**. The clean data is then stored in a PostgreSQL database, readily available for analysis and visualization through an interactive dashboard.

- [Spreadsheet SQL Mapper](https://github.com/johnfritzel/spreadsheet-sql-mapper): This Django API lets you upload spreadsheets (.xls or .xlsx only) and import their data into your database. It checks for:
  - Valid file formats (xls/xlsx)
  - Empty files
  - Blank cells within the spreadsheet
  <p>If the table you specify doesn't exist, the API creates it automatically. Then, it imports the data from the spreadsheet.</p>

- [CRM Application](https://github.com/johnfritzel/crm-application): A Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application built using Django for the backend and Bootstrap and JavaScript for the frontend. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing customer data and interactions.
